#DATA

A subsample of 3374, 419 and 385 grayscale images from TFD as the training,
validation and testing set respectively. Each image is of size 48 x 48
and contains a face that has been extracted from a variety of sources. The
faces have been rotated, scaled and aligned to make the task easier. The faces
have been labeled by experts and research assistants based on their expression.
These expressions fall into one of seven categories: 1-Anger, 2-Disgust,
3-Fear, 4-Happy, 5-Sad, 6-Surprise, 7-Neutral
